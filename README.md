# Deep-Learning-and-Decision-Tree-Approach-for-Detecting-Survivors-in-Disaster-Debris
This project uses deep learning and decision tree methods to find people trapped under rubble after disasters like earthquakes or building collapses. By analyzing images, the system can detect human body parts and highlight possible survivors. This helps rescue teams quickly locate and save lives.
